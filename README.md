# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements a real-time data stream simulator and an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) anomaly detection system, visualized using matplotlib. The system simulates a data stream, applies EWMA to detect anomalies in real-time, and dynamically plots the data, the EWMA, and any anomalies detected.
